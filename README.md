# RedditClone App 
## My Angular 4 up-skilling. 
*Based on the lessons from the NG-Book by Nate Murray et al* 

My learning lessons from this project:

1. Contract Definition with TypeScript
2. Bind Inputs to Values
3. Understand The Component Host
4. Initiate Component Properties
5. Prevent Click Propagation
6. Define Data Structures with Models


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.2.3.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
