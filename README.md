# My Angular 4 up-skilling: Reddit-Clone App 
*My learning lessons from this project based on the lessons from the NG-Book by Nate Murray et al. This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.2.3.*

## 1. Contract Definition with TypeScript
Typescript helps us define the type of parameters we can expect to receive in our click-event-triggered function. Notice how helpful it is for a developer to understand where the parameters should come from. **Title** and **Link** are the parameters we have defined and as we can see in the contract, **they should always be of type: HTMLInputElement**, ie coming from our HTML input form inside the relevant view. 
```typescript
addNewArticle( title: HTMLInputElement, link: HTMLInputElement)
```

## 2. Binding Inputs to Values

Having defined our function's parameters, we need to find a way to capture whatever we type into the formâ€™s input fields. As any other programming paradigm, we do this by capturing the input into a special kind of local variable called: **a template variable**.

```html
<input name="title" #newTitle >
```

The hashtag syntax (#newTitle) of the template variable is called a **RESOLVE**. The effect of the resolve is to make our new variable(newTitle) available to any expression within our view **hence local not global**

Our template variable is actually an **object** and as such it contains a .type property which we have defined to be of type HTMLInpuElement and a **.value property in which we can now find the value of whatever we type into the html input: newTitle.value**

## 3. Understanding the Component Host

A component host is the HTML element on which we are attaching our component. In this case it is essentially the <app-article> html tag. What we want to achieve is to SYNCHRONISE the value of the html attribute of host element's (in this case a css class) with our component-class property called cssClass. Noteice how we have define this property on our component definition:
```typescript
export class ArticleComponent {
  @HostBinding('attr.class') cssClass = "row";
}
```

As always, due to Angular's modularity, HostBinding is a Decorator which we can be imported from the @angular/core package:

```typescript
import { Component, HostBinding, Input } from '@angular/core';
```
